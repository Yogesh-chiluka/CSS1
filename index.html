<p id="p1" class="odd">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] <br>         CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>

<p id="p2" class="even">CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the <br> specification of  presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, <br> which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

<div id="hi">Hi</div>
<div id="hi1">Hi</div>
<p id="p3" class="odd">Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice<br> (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]</p>
<div class="img"><img src="image.jpeg" height="100px" width="100px"></div>
<p id="p4" class="even">The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.</p>

<p id="p5" class="odd">The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation<br> service for CSS documents.[5]</p>

<p id="p6" class="even">In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.</p>
